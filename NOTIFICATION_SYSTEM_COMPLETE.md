# ðŸ”” Notification System Implementation

## âœ… Features Added

### 1. **Unread Messages Hook** (`src/hooks/useUnreadMessages.js`)
- Tracks unread message count for sellers
- Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions
- Automatically updates when messages are marked as read
- Handles user authentication states

### 2. **Notification Badge Component** (`src/components/NotificationBadge.js`)
- Reusable red notification badge
- Displays count (shows "99+" for counts over 99)
- Only shows when count > 0
- Customizable styling with className prop

### 3. **Main Page Sidebar Integration** (`src/app/page.js`)
- Added notification badge to "Your messages" button
- Shows unread count in real-time
- Only visible when user is authenticated and has unread messages
- Updated button layout to accommodate badge

### 4. **Enhanced Messages Page** (`src/app/messages/page.js`)
- Updated to use NotificationBadge component
- Added "Mark as Read" functionality with loading states
- Shows unread count in header
- Visual indicators for unread messages (blue highlighting)
- Existing features preserved (modal, email replies, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

1. **Real-time Updates**: When someone sends a message, the notification appears immediately via Supabase real-time subscriptions
2. **Visual Indicators**: Unread messages show with blue highlighting and notification badges
3. **Mark as Read**: Clicking on a message or using the "Mark as Read" button updates the status
4. **Count Display**: Shows exact count for small numbers, "99+" for large counts

## ðŸ”§ Database Requirements

The notification system requires the messages table with:
- `seller_id` field to identify message recipients
- `read_by_seller` boolean field to track read status
- Proper RLS policies for security

## ðŸš€ Testing

Once the messages table is created in Supabase:
1. User A creates a listing
2. User B sends a message about that listing
3. User A sees a red notification badge on "Your messages" button
4. User A clicks on messages to view and mark as read
5. Notification badge disappears when all messages are read

## ðŸ“± UI Elements

- **Sidebar**: Red notification badge on "Your messages" button
- **Messages Page**: Header shows unread count badge
- **Message List**: Blue highlighting for unread messages
- **Individual Messages**: Visual indicators and mark-as-read buttons

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

- Uses Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Red notification badges for attention
- Blue highlighting for unread states
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

**Status**: Implementation complete âœ…  
**Next Step**: Create messages table in Supabase to enable functionality
